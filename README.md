# SQL-Challenge

## Background

This challenge was to create a functional database from six CSV files in POSTGRESQL, demonstrating both data engineering and analyst SQL skills. In the planning phase, I designed a schema diagram which illustrated tables, data types, relationships, primary keys, foreign keys and other constraints. I then created a database and tables using the schema diagram as my guide. The CSVs were then imported into the POSTGRESQL database, allowing me to easily analyze the large datasets and gain valuable insights.

## Analysis

I was tasked to create SQL queries to pull and analyze data from my new database and answer the following questions:

* List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

* List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

* List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

* List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

* List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

* List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

* List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

* In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

## Deliverables

To demonstrate my skills as a data engineer and analyst, I submitted the following deliverables to show my work:

*  Create an image file of your ERD.  (https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

*  Create a .sql file of your table schemata.

*  Create a .sql file of your queries.
